# Computational Physics with Python
In this repository, you can find Jupyter notebooks which cover some fundamental topics on the computational physics course. <br>
Topics are including but not limited to: <br>
* Random Walk;
* Solving Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs);
* Percolation;
* Monte Carlo Simulations;
* etc,.<br><br>
I will try to update this repository and include more projects in it. ;) <br>
<br>
You can follow various references for Computational Physics. For example, you can refer to [this book](https://www.wiley.com) .
