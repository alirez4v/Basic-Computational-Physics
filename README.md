# Computational Physics with Python
In this repository, you can find Jupyter notebooks which cover some fundamental topics on the computational physics course. <br>
Topics are including but not limited to:
* Random Walk;
* Solving Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs);
* Percolation;
* Monte Carlo Simulations;
* etc,. <br>
I will try update this repository and include more projects in it. ;)
